# Agora

![sbt test cucumber](https://travis-ci.org/aaronp/agora.svg?branch=master)

'Agora' is a reactive, distributed work-exchange for pairing work items with workers requesting work.

The name is taken from the greek work for 'marketplace', as it is essentially an exchange of [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/).

You can read more about the design and check the documentation [here](https://aaronp.github.io/agora)
