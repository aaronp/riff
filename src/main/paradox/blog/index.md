I'm sure this exists as "a thing" somewhere already, but I've only just thought of it...
The idea of producing a blog entry along side code commits.

This way, instead of a wordy code comment (which may get out of date), this blog will
live alongside code as a dump of my (and others') thought processes while we're writing
the code.

It doesn't take the place of code comments, but also makes it easier to just put down
a lot of thoughts w/o having to worry about maintaining it the same way as if it were
part of the codebase.
